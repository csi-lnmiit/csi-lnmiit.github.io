						The knowledge we earn and
wisdom we learn is imparted by
our Gurus, our teachers, who
unveils the hidden capabilities
within each and every student.
The CSI Council expressed their
sincere gratitude and deep
respects by organizing an event
for the very first time in the
history of the college, as a tribute
to their teachers, their mentors of
life. They embraced the divinity of this bond.

						The event uncovered with lightening of lamp and students expressed how thankful they
were to have a guiding front man
as him. The event paved its way
through a short welcome speech
by the Director Sir, who expressed
the joy he felt, by this touching
concern and warmth of the
students. He ignited the spark of
confidence in each student,
through his well-crafted words.

						Following him next was a song in
mellifluous voice of Sakthi Balan sir. He
sang a song in Carnatic music and not only
was it soothing but also depicted that the
teachers too are filled with hidden
surprises.

						Following them with a unique
idea cherished with a nostalgic
cherry, a skit was performed by
the Sankalp Club. The skit
imparted a wonderful message
in a subtle manner to each and
every person seated over there.
It taught us the importance a
human can gain through a
perfect supervision of a Guru.
The confidence that we are
boosted with through this light,
breaks us apart from the
shackles of our own conservatism.

						Without losing the excitement of the
event, to continue it forward, a group of
teachers came up on stage and gave
song performances. Indeed, it was
equivalent to going down the memory
lane of their own college times. The
musical performance, lightened the
mood and instigated a blithe among the
teachers and the students. Through their
song they elaborated how they miss
their childhood lives and their teachers, which were the best days one could ever have.

						To add onto the beautiful
moments, Beena Gokhale ma’am
was invited on stage, for the
much awaited performance. She
had beautifully written a poem
showcasing the love and
affection that is instilled with
deep respect, between a
student-teacher relationship. Her
poetry was indeed mesmerizing
in words and deep in
interpretation, an inspiring set of
words for the audience.

						A short exciting quiz was also conducted, for
pouring a fun and informal taste to the event.
Each teacher was asked to pen down their
most beautiful moment in the college and
then the papers were shuffled among all. The
other teacher, marked the moment out of a
score of 20. The best ones, were then later
read out aloud to all, which mainly comprised
of ‘this very moment’ taglines and ‘the
moment they acquired a position of being someone’s teacher’.

						Lined up after the quiz was a closing speech
by Dr. Gorthi Sir, who saluted the efforts of
the CSI Council and wished them the best
of their lucks and motivated them to have
faith in self, for attainment of their dreams.
High tea was organized after this and on a
cheerful note the event was ended with
balloon blasting activity!
